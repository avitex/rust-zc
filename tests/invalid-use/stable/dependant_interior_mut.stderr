  = help: within `StructWithBytes<'static>`, the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `RefCell<&'static [u8]>`
  = note: required because it appears within the type `StructWithBytes<'static>`
  = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
